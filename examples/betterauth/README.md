# Better Auth Integration Example

This example demonstrates how to integrate [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) with Jazz.

## Getting started

To run this example, you may either:
* Clone the Jazz monorepo and run this example from within.
* Create a new Jazz project using this example as a template, and run that new project.

### Setting environment variables
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_BASE_URL`: A URL to a Better Auth server. If undefined, the example will self-host a Better Auth server.
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`: The encryption secret used by the self-hosted Better Auth server (required only if `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_BASE_URL` is undefined)
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`: The client ID for the GitHub OAuth provider used by the self-hosted Better Auth server (required only if `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_BASE_URL` is undefined)
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`: The client secret for the GitHub OAuth provider used by the self-hosted Better Auth server (required only if `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_BASE_URL` is undefined)

### Using this example as a template

1. Create a new Jazz project, and use this example as a template.
```sh
npx create-jazz-app@latest betterauth-app --example betterauth
```
2. Navigate to the new project and start the development server.
```sh
cd betterauth-app
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### Using the monorepo

This requires `pnpm` to be installed, see [https://pnpm.io/installation](https://pnpm.io/installation).

Clone the jazz repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/garden-co/jazz.git
```

Install and build dependencies.
```bash
pnpm i && npx turbo build
```

Go to the example directory.
```bash
cd jazz/examples/betterauth/
```

Start the dev server.
```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
