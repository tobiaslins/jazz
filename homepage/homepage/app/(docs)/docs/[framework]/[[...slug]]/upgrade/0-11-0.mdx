# Jazz 0.11.0 is out!

Jazz 0.11.0 brings several improvements to member handling, roles, and permissions management. This guide will help you upgrade your application to the latest version.

## What's new?
Here is what's changed in this release:
- [New permissions check APIs](#new-permissions-check-apis): New methods like `canRead`, `canWrite`, `canAdmin`, and `getRoleOf` to simplify permission checks.
- [Group.revokeExtend](#grouprevokeextend): New method to revoke group extension permissions.
- [Group.getParentGroups](#accountgetparentgroups): New method to get all the parent groups of an account.
- [Account Profile & Migrations](#account-profile--migrations): Fixed issues with custom account profile migrations for a more consistent experience
- [Dropped support for Accounts owning Profiles](#dropped-support-for-accounts-owning-profiles): Profiles can now only be owned by Groups.
- [Group.members now includes inherited members](#member-inheritance-changes): Updated behavior for the `members` getter method to include inherited members and have a more intuitive type definition.

## New Features

### New permissions check APIs

New methods have been added to both `Account` and `Group` classes to improve permission handling:

#### Permission checks

The new `canRead`, `canWrite` and `canAdmin` methods on `Account` allow you to easily check if the account has specific permissions on a CoValue:

<CodeGroup>
{/* prettier-ignore */}
```typescript
const me = Account.getMe();

if (me.canAdmin(value)) {
  console.log("I can share value with others"); 
} else if (me.canWrite(value)) {
  console.log("I can edit value");
} else if (me.canRead(value)) {
  console.log("I can view value");
} else {
  console.log("I cannot access value");
}
```
</CodeGroup>

#### Getting the role of an account

The `getRoleOf` method has been added to query the role of specific entities:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript
const group = Group.create();
group.getRoleOf(me); // admin
group.getRoleOf(Eve); // undefined

group.addMember(Eve, "writer");
group.getRoleOf(Eve); // writer
```
</CodeGroup>

#### Group.revokeExtend

We added a new method to revoke the extend of a Group:
<CodeGroup>
```typescript
function addTrackToPlaylist(playlist: Playlist, track: MusicTrack) {
  const trackGroup = track._owner.castAs(Group);
  trackGroup.extend(playlist._owner, "reader"); // Grant read access to the track to the playlist accounts

  playlist.tracks.push(track);
}

function removeTrackFromPlaylist(playlist: Playlist, track: MusicTrack) {
  const trackGroup = track._owner.castAs(Group);
  trackGroup.revokeExtend(playlist._owner); // Revoke access to the track to the playlist accounts
  
  const index = playlist.tracks.findIndex(t => t.id === track.id);
  if (index !== -1) {
    playlist.tracks.splice(index, 1);
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Group.getParentGroups

The `getParentGroups` method has been added to `Group` to get all the parent groups of a group.

<CodeGroup>
```ts
const childGroup = Group.create();
const parentGroup = Group.create();
childGroup.extend(parentGroup);

console.log(childGroup.getParentGroups()); // [parentGroup]
```
</CodeGroup>

## Breaking Changes

### Account Profile & Migrations

The previous way of making the `Profile` migration work was to assume that the profile was always already there:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
export class MyAppAccount extends Account {
  profile = co.ref(MyAppProfile);

  async migrate(this: MyAppAccount, creationProps: { name: string, lastName: string }) {
    if (creationProps) {
      const { profile } = await this.ensureLoaded({ profile: {} });

      profile.name = creationProps.name;
      profile.bookmarks = ListOfBookmarks.create([], profileGroup);
    }
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

This was kind-of tricky to picture, and having different migration strategies for different CoValues was confusing.

We changed the logic so the default profile is created only if you didn't provide one in your migration.

This way you can use the same pattern for both `root` and `profile` migrations:
<CodeGroup>
```ts
export class MyAppAccount extends Account {
  profile = co.ref(MyAppProfile);

  async migrate(this: MyAppAccount, creationProps?: { name: string }) {
    if (this.profile === undefined) {
      const profileGroup = Group.create();
      profileGroup.addMember("everyone", "reader");

      this.profile = MyAppProfile.create({
        name: creationProps?.name,
        bookmarks: ListOfBookmarks.create([], profileGroup),
      }, profileGroup);
    }
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Alert variant="warning" title="Warning" className="mt-4">
If you provide a custom `Profile` in your `Account` schema and migration for a Worker account, 
make sure to also add  `everyone` as member with `reader` role to the owning group. 
Failing to do so will prevent any account from sending messages to the Worker's Inbox.
</Alert>

### Dropped support for Accounts owning Profiles
Starting from `0.11.0` `Profile`s can only be owned by `Group`s.

<Alert variant="info" title="Note" className="mt-4">
Existing profiles owned by `Account`s will still work, but you will get incorrect types when accessing a `Profile`'s `_owner`.
</Alert>

### Member Inheritance Changes

The behavior of groups' `members` getter method has been updated to return both direct members and inherited ones from ancestor groups. 
This might affect your application if you were relying on only direct members being returned.

<CodeGroup>
```ts
/**
 *  The following pseudocode only illustrates the inheritance logic, 
 *  the actual implementation is different.
*/

const parentGroup = Group.create();
parentGroup.addMember(John, "admin");

const childGroup = Group.create();
childGroup.addMember(Eve, "admin");

childGroup.extend(parentGroup);

console.log(childGroup.members);
// Before 0.11.0
// [Eve]

// After 0.11.0
// [Eve, John]
```
</CodeGroup>

Additionally:
- now `Group.members` doesn't include the `everyone` member anymore
- the account type in `Group.members` is now the globally registered Account schema and we have removed the `co.members` way to define an AccountSchema for members

If you need to explicitly check if "everyone" is a member of a group, you can use the `getRoleOf` method instead:
<CodeGroup>
```ts
if (group.getRoleOf("everyone")) {
  console.log("Everyone has access to the group");
}
```
</CodeGroup>


#### Migration Steps

1. Review your member querying logic to account for inherited members.
2. Update your permission checking code to utilize the new [`hasPermissions` and `getRoleOf`](#enhanced-permission-management) methods.
3. Consider implementing `"everyone"` role checks where appropriate.

### Removed auto-update of `profile.name` in `usePasskeyAuth`

The `usePasskeyAuth` hook now doesn't update the `profile.name` if the provided username is empty.

## Troubleshooting

> I'm getting the following error: `Error: Profile must be owned by a Group`

If you previously forced a migration of your `Account` schema to include a custom `Profile`, 
and assigned its ownership to an `Account`, you need to recreate your profile code and assign it to a `Group` instead.

<CodeGroup>
```ts
export class MyAppAccount extends Account {
  profile = co.ref(MyAppProfile);

  override async migrate() {
    // ...

    const me = await this.ensureLoaded({
      profile: {},
    });

    if ((me.profile._owner as Group | Account)._type === "Account") {
      const profileGroup = Group.create();
      profileGroup.addMember("everyone", "reader");

      // recreate your profile here...
      me.profile = Profile.create(
        {
          name: me.profile.name,
        },
        profileGroup,
      );
    }
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>
