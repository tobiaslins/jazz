# React Native (Expo) Installation and Setup

Jazz supports Expo through the dedicated `jazz-expo` package, which is specifically designed for Expo applications. If you're building for React Native without Expo, please refer to the [React Native](/docs/react-native/project-setup) guide instead.

Jazz requires an [Expo development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/) using [Expo Prebuild](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/prebuild/) for native code. It is **not compatible** with Expo Go. Jazz also supports the [New Architecture](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/new-architecture/).

Tested with:

<CodeGroup>
```json 
"expo": "~52.0.0", 
"react-native": "0.76.7", 
"react": "18.3.1"
```
</CodeGroup>

## Installation

### Create a new project

(Skip this step if you already have one)

<CodeGroup>
```bash
npx create-expo-app -e with-router-tailwind my-jazz-app
cd my-jazz-app
npx expo prebuild
```
</CodeGroup>

### Install dependencies

<CodeGroup>
```bash
# Expo dependencies
npx expo install expo-linking expo-secure-store expo-file-system @react-native-community/netinfo @bam.tech/react-native-image-resizer

# React Native polyfills
npm i -S @azure/core-asynciterator-polyfill react-native-url-polyfill readable-stream react-native-get-random-values @craftzdog/react-native-buffer

# Jazz dependencies
npm i -S jazz-tools jazz-expo jazz-react-native-media-images
```
</CodeGroup>

**Note**: Hermes has added support for `atob` and `btoa` in React Native 0.74. If you are using earlier versions, you may also need to polyfill `atob` and `btoa` in your `package.json`. Packages to try include: `text-encoding`, `base-64`, and you can drop `@bacons/text-decoder`.

#### Fix incompatible dependencies

If you encounter incompatible dependencies, you can try to fix them with the following command:

<CodeGroup>
```bash
npx expo install --fix
```
</CodeGroup>

### Configure Metro

#### Regular repositories

If you are not working within a monorepo, create a new file `metro.config.js` in the root of your project with the following content:

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
// @noErrors: 2304
// metro.config.js
const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config"); 
const config = getDefaultConfig(projectRoot); 
  
config.resolver.sourceExts = ["mjs", "js", "json", "ts", "tsx"]; 
config.resolver.requireCycleIgnorePatterns = [/(^|\/|\\)node_modules($|\/|\\)/]; 
  
module.exports = config; 
```
</CodeGroup>

#### Monorepos

For monorepos, use the following `metro.config.js`:

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
// @noErrors: 2304
// metro.config.js
const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");
const { FileStore } = require("metro-cache");
const path = require("path");

// eslint-disable-next-line no-undef
const projectRoot = __dirname;
const workspaceRoot = path.resolve(projectRoot, "../..");

const config = getDefaultConfig(projectRoot);

config.watchFolders = [workspaceRoot];
config.resolver.nodeModulesPaths = [
  path.resolve(projectRoot, "node_modules"),
  path.resolve(workspaceRoot, "node_modules"),
];
config.resolver.sourceExts = ["mjs", "js", "json", "ts", "tsx"];
config.resolver.requireCycleIgnorePatterns = [/(^|\/|\\)node_modules($|\/|\\)/];
config.cacheStores = [
  new FileStore({
    root: path.join(projectRoot, "node_modules", ".cache", "metro"),
  }),
];

module.exports = config;
```
</CodeGroup>

### Additional monorepo configuration (for pnpm)

If you're using `pnpm`, you'll need to make sure that your expo app's `package.json` has this:

<CodeGroup>
```json
// package.json
{
  "main": "index.js",
  ...
}
```
</CodeGroup>

For more information, refer to [this Expo monorepo example](https://github.com/byCedric/expo-monorepo-example#pnpm-workarounds).

## Authentication

Jazz provides authentication to help users access their data across multiple devices. For details on implementing authentication with Expo, check our [Authentication Overview](/docs/authentication/overview) guide and see the [Expo Chat Demo](https://github.com/garden-co/jazz/tree/main/examples/chat-rn-expo-clerk) for a complete example.

## Next Steps

Now that you've set up your Expo project for Jazz, you'll need to:

1. [Set up the Jazz Provider](/docs/react-native-expo/project-setup/providers) - Configure how your app connects to Jazz
2. [Add authentication](/docs/authentication/overview) (optional) - Enable users to access data across devices
3. Define your schema - See the [schema docs](/docs/schemas/covalues) for more information
4. Run your app:

<CodeGroup>
```sh
npx expo run:ios
# or
npx expo run:android
```
</CodeGroup>

## Verification

Ready to see if everything's working? Let's fire up your app:

<CodeGroup>
```sh
npx expo run:ios
# or
npx expo run:android
```
</CodeGroup>

If all goes well, your app should start up without any angry red error screens. Take a quick look at the Metro console too - no Jazz-related errors there means you're all set! If you see your app's UI come up smoothly, you've nailed the installation.

If you run into any issues that aren't covered in the Common Issues section, [drop by our Discord for help](https://discord.gg/utDMjHYg42).

## Common Issues

- **Metro bundler errors**: If you see errors about missing polyfills, ensure all polyfills are properly imported.
- **iOS build failures**: Make sure you've run `pod install` after adding the dependencies.
- **Android build failures**: Ensure you've run `npx expo prebuild` to generate native code.
- **Expo Go incompatibility**: Remember that Jazz requires a development build and won't work with Expo Go.

### Install CocoaPods

If you're compiling for iOS, you'll need to install CocoaPods for your project. If you need to install it, we recommend using [`pod-install`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pod-install):

<CodeGroup>
```bash
npx pod-install
```
</CodeGroup>
