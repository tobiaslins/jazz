# Better Auth authentication

[Better Auth](https://better-auth.com/) is a self-hosted, framework-agnostic authentication and authorisation framework for TypeScript.

You can integrate Better Auth with your Jazz app, allowing your Jazz user's account keys to be saved with the corresponding Better Auth user.

## How it works

When using Better Auth authentication:
1. Users sign up or sign in through Better Auth's authentication system
2. Jazz securely stores the user's account keys with Better Auth
3. When logging in, Jazz retrieves these keys from Better Auth
4. Once authenticated, users can work offline with full Jazz functionality

This authentication method is not fully local-first, as login and signup need to be done online, but once authenticated, users can use all of Jazz's features without needing to be online.

## Authentication methods and plugins

Better Auth supports several authentication methods and plugins. The Jazz plugin has not been tested with all of them yet. Here is the compatibility matrix:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Better Auth method/plugin</th>
      <th>Jazz plugin</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Email/Password</td>
      <td>✅</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Social Providers</td>
      <td>✅</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Username</td>
      <td>❓</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Anonymous</td>
      <td>❓</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Phone Number</td>
      <td>❓</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Magic Link</td>
      <td>❓</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Email OTP</td>
      <td>✅</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Passkey</td>
      <td>❓</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>One Tap</td>
      <td>❓</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

✅: tested and working
❓: not tested yet
❌: not supported

## Getting started

First of all, follow the [Better Auth documentation](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/installation) to install Better Auth:
- Install the dependency and set env variables
- Create the betterAuth instance in the common `auth.ts` file, using the database adapter you want. {/* here the assist for next Jazz database adapter */}
- Set up the authentication methods you want to use
- Mount the handler in the API route
- Create the client instance in the common `auth-client.ts` file

The `jazz-tools/better-auth/auth` plugin provides both server-side and client-side integration for Better Auth with Jazz. Here's how to set it up:

### Server Setup

Add the `jazzPlugin` to the Better Auth instance:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript
// src/lib/auth.ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { jazzPlugin } from "jazz-tools/better-auth/auth/server";

// Your Better Auth server configuration
export const auth = betterAuth({
  // Add the Jazz plugin
  plugins: [
    jazzPlugin(),
    // other server plugins
  ],

  // rest of the Better Auth configuration
  // like database, email/password authentication, social providers, etc.
});
```
</CodeGroup>

Now run [migrations](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/concepts/database#running-migrations) to add the new fields to the users table.

<Alert variant="warning" className="mt-4" title="Note">
  The server-side plugin intercepts the custom header `x-jazz-auth` sent by client-side plugin. If server is behind a proxy, the header must be forwarded. If the server runs on a different origin than the client, the header must be allowed for cross-origin requests.
</Alert>

### Client Setup

Create the Better Auth client with the Jazz plugin:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript
// src/lib/auth-client.ts
"use client";

import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
import { jazzPluginClient } from "jazz-tools/better-auth/auth/client";

export const betterAuthClient = createAuthClient({
  plugins: [
    jazzPluginClient(),
    // other client plugins
  ],
});
```
</CodeGroup>

<ContentByFramework framework={["react", "react-native", "react-native-expo"]}>

Wrap your app with the `AuthProvider`, passing the `betterAuthClient` instance:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript
// src/App.tsx
"use client";

import { AuthProvider } from "jazz-tools/better-auth/auth/react";
import { betterAuthClient } from "@/lib/auth-client";


export function App() {
  return (
    /* Other providers (e.g. your Jazz Provider) */
    <AuthProvider betterAuthClient={betterAuthClient}>
      {/* your app */}
    </AuthProvider>
  );
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Alert variant="warning" className="mt-4" title="Important">
  The AuthProvider component uses the `better-auth/client` package, not `better-auth/react`.
  To verify the authentication state in your app, see <a href="#authentication-states" aria-label="Jump to Authentication states section">Authentication states</a>.
</Alert>

</ContentByFramework>

<ContentByFramework framework={["vanilla", "svelte"]}>

Set JazzContext and AuthSecretStorage in the Better Auth client:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
const jazzContext = // get the singleton from your own implementation
const authSecretStorage = // get the singleton from your own implementation

betterAuthClient.jazz.setJazzContext(jazzContext);
betterAuthClient.jazz.setAuthSecretStorage(authSecretStorage);
```
</CodeGroup>

</ContentByFramework>

## Authentication methods

The Jazz plugin intercepts the Better Auth client's calls, so you can use the Better Auth [methods](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/basic-usage) as usual.

Here is how to sign up with email and password, and transform an anonymous Jazz account into a logged in user authenticated by Better Auth:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
import { betterAuthClient } from "@/lib/auth-client";

await betterAuthClient.signUp.email(
  {
    email: "email@example.com",
    password: "password",
    name: "John Doe",
  },
  {
    onSuccess: async () => {
      // Don't forget to update the profile's name. It's not done automatically.
      if (account?.me?.profile) {
        account.me.profile.$jazz.set("name", "John Doe");
      }
    },
  }
);
```
</CodeGroup>

You can then use the `signIn` and `signOut` methods on the `betterAuthClient`:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
import { betterAuthClient } from "@/lib/auth-client";

await betterAuthClient.signIn.email({
  email: "email@example.com",
  password: "password",
});

await betterAuthClient.signOut();
```
</CodeGroup>

## Authentication states

Although Better Auth is not fully local-first, the Jazz client plugin tries to keep Jazz's authentication state in sync with Better Auth's. The best practice to check if the user is authenticated is using Jazz's methods [as described here](/docs/key-features/authentication/authentication-states#detecting-authentication-state).

You can use Better Auth's [native methods](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/basic-usage#session) if you need to check the Better Auth state directly.


## Server-side hooks

Better Auth provides [database hooks](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/reference/options#databasehooks) to run code when things happen. When using the Jazz, the user's Jazz account ID is always available in the `user` object. This means you can access it anywhere in Better Auth hooks.

<CodeGroup>
```ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { jazzPlugin } from "jazz-tools/better-auth/auth/server";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [jazzPlugin()],
  databaseHooks: {
    user: {
      create: {
        async after(user) {
          // Here we can send a welcome email to the user
          console.log("User created with Jazz Account ID:", user.accountID);
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```
</CodeGroup>
