# Setup troubleshooting

A few reported setup hiccups and how to fix them.

## Node.js version requirements

Jazz requires **Node.js v20 or later** due to native module dependencies.  
Check your version:

<CodeGroup>
```sh
node -v
```
</CodeGroup>
If you’re on Node 18 or earlier, upgrade via nvm:

<CodeGroup>
```sh
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
```
</CodeGroup>
---
## npx jazz-run: command not found
If, when running:
<CodeGroup>
```sh
npx jazz-run sync
```
</CodeGroup>

you encounter:

<CodeGroup>
```sh
sh: jazz-run: command not found
```
</CodeGroup>

This is often due to an npx cache quirk. (For most apps using Jazz)

1. Clear your npx cache:

<CodeGroup>
```sh
npx clear-npx-cache
```
</CodeGroup>

2. Rerun the command:

<CodeGroup>
```sh
npx jazz-run sync
```
</CodeGroup>

### Node 18 workaround (rebuilding the native module)

If you can’t upgrade to Node 20+, you can rebuild the native `better-sqlite3` module for your architecture.

1. Install `jazz-run` locally in your project:

<CodeGroup>
```sh
pnpm add -D jazz-run
```
</CodeGroup>

2. Find the installed version of better-sqlite3 inside node_modules.
It should look like this:

<CodeGroup>
```sh
./node_modules/.pnpm/better-sqlite3{version}/node_modules/better-sqlite3
```
</CodeGroup>

Replace `{version}` with your installed version and run:

<CodeGroup>
```sh
# Navigate to the installed module and rebuild
pushd ./node_modules/.pnpm/better-sqlite3{version}/node_modules/better-sqlite3
&& pnpm install
&& popd
```
</CodeGroup>
If you get ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'distutils':
Linux:

<CodeGroup>
```sh
pip install --upgrade setuptools
```
</CodeGroup>
macOS:

<CodeGroup>
```sh
brew install python-setuptools
```
</CodeGroup>

### Still having trouble?
If none of the above fixes work:

Make sure dependencies installed without errors (`pnpm install`).

Double-check your `node -v` output matches the required version.

Open an issue on GitHub with:

- Your OS and version

- Node.js version

- Steps you ran and full error output
