# History & time-travel

One of Jazz's most powerful features is that every CoValue automatically tracks its complete edit history. This means you can see who changed what and when, examine the state of your data at any point in time, and build features like audit logs, activity feeds, and undo/redo functionality. This page explores how to access and work with the rich metadata that comes with every CoValue.

## Understanding Edit History

Every CoValue in Jazz maintains a full history of all changes made to it. This edit history is accessible through two main APIs:

`CoValue._edits` provides a structured, field-by-field view of a CoValue's edit history. It organizes edits by property name and makes them easily accessible. For each field:
- `_edits.fieldName` gives you the most recent edit
- `_edits.fieldName.all` provides all historical edits as an array
- `_edits.fieldName.madeAt` gives you the timestamp of the last edit
- Each edit contains the value, who made the change, and when it happened

`CoValue._raw` gives you access to the internal state and lower-level operations on a CoValue. As this is an internal API, it should be used with caution. If you find yourself using `_raw`, consider letting us know so we can consider adding a public API for your use case.

## Working with Edit History Metadata

CoValues track who made each change and when. Every edit has metadata attached to it, including the author, timestamp, value, and transaction ID. This metadata enables you to build powerful audit and history features without having to implement your own tracking system.

<CodeGroup>
```ts
class Task extends CoMap {
  title = coField.string;
  description = coField.string;
  status = coField.literal("todo", "in-progress", "completed");
  priority = coField.literal("low", "medium", "high");
  subtasks = coField.optional.ref(ListOfTasks);
}

class ListOfTasks extends CoList.Of(coField.ref(Task)) {}

const task = Task.create({
  title: "Plant spring vegetables",
  description: "Plant peas, carrots, and lettuce in the south garden bed",
  status: "todo",
  priority: "medium",
});

// Change the status
task.status = "in-progress";

// Get the latest edit for a field
console.log("Latest edit:", task._edits.status);
// { value: "in-progress", by: Account, madeAt: Date, ... }

// Get when a field was last edited (timestamp)
const lastEditTime = task._edits.status.madeAt;
console.log(`Status was last changed at: ${lastEditTime?.toLocaleString()}`);

// Get the full edit history for a field
for (const edit of task._edits.status.all) {
  console.log({
    author: edit.by,        // Account that made the change
    timestamp: edit.madeAt, // When the change happened
    value: edit.value,      // Value of the change
  });
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Common Patterns

With knowledge of the edit history, you can build all sorts of useful features that enhance your application's user experience and administrative capabilities. Here are some common patterns that leverage CoValue metadata.

#### Audit Log

Getting all the changes to a CoValue in order allows you to build an audit log. This is especially useful for tracking important changes in collaborative environments or for compliance purposes:

<CodeGroup>
```ts

function getAuditLog(task: Task) {
  const changes = [];

  for (const field of Object.keys(task)) {
    // Check if the field has edits to avoid accessing non-existent properties
    if (task._edits[field as keyof typeof task._edits]) {
      for (const edit of task._edits[field as keyof typeof task._edits].all) {
        changes.push({
          field,
          ...edit,
          timestamp: edit.madeAt,
          at: edit.madeAt,
          by: edit.by,
        });
      }
    }
  }

  // Sort by timestamp
  return changes.sort((a, b) => b.at.getTime() - a.at.getTime());
}

// Example usage
const auditLog = getAuditLog(task);
auditLog.forEach((entry) => {
  console.log(
    `${entry.timestamp} - ${entry.field} changed to "${entry.value}" by ${entry.by?.id}`,
  );
});
```
</CodeGroup>

#### Activity Feeds

Activity feeds are a great way to see recent changes to a CoValue, helping users understand what's happening in a collaborative workspace. They can show who did what and when, creating transparency in team environments:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
function getRecentActivity(project: Project) {
  const activity = [];
  const hourAgo = new Date(Date.now() - 3600000);

  for (const field of Object.keys(project)) {
    // Skip if the field doesn't have edits
    if (!project._edits[field as keyof typeof project._edits]) continue;

    for (const edit of project._edits[field as keyof typeof project._edits].all) {
      if (edit.madeAt > hourAgo) {
        activity.push({
          field,
          value: edit.value,
          by: edit.by,
          at: edit.madeAt
        });
      }
    }
  }

  return activity.sort((a, b) => b.at.getTime() - a.at.getTime());
}

// Example usage
const recentActivity = getRecentActivity(gardenProject);
console.log("Recent Garden Activity:");
recentActivity.forEach(activity => {
  console.log(`${activity.at.toLocaleString()} - ${activity.field} updated by ${activity.by?.id}`);
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Edit History & Time Travel

CoValues track their entire history of changes, creating a timeline you can explore. You can see who changed what and when, or even view past states of the data. This capability enables powerful debugging tools and user-facing features like history browsing and restoration of previous versions:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
class Task extends CoMap {
  title = coField.string;
  description = coField.string;
  status = coField.literal("todo", "in-progress", "completed");
  priority = coField.literal("low", "medium", "high");
}

// Create a new task
const task = Task.create({
  title: "Plant spring vegetables",
  description: "Plant peas, carrots, and lettuce in the south garden bed",
  status: "todo",
  priority: "medium",
});

// Make some changes
task.status = "in-progress";
task.priority = "high";

// See all edits for a field
for (const edit of task._edits.status.all) {
  console.log(
    `${edit.madeAt.toISOString()}: Status changed to "${edit.value}" by ${edit.by?.id}`,
  );
}

// Get the initial value
const initialStatus = task._edits.status.all[0]?.value;
console.log(`Original status: ${initialStatus}`);

// Get a specific edit by index
const previousEdit = task._edits.status.all[1]; // Second edit
console.log(`Previous status: ${previousEdit?.value}`);

// Check who made the most recent change
const latestEdit = task._edits.status;
console.log(`Latest change made by: ${latestEdit?.by?.id}`);
```
</CodeGroup>

## Time Travel

The ability to view a CoValue as it existed at any point in time is one of Jazz's most powerful features. Looking into the past can help you understand how things changed - perfect for audit logs, debugging, or showing user activity. You can reconstruct the exact state of any CoValue at any moment in its history:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
class Project extends CoMap {
  name = coField.string;
  status = coField.literal("planning", "active", "completed");
  lastUpdate = coField.Date;
}

// See when a project was started
function findStatusChange(project: Project, targetStatus: string) {
  // Get all the edits for the status field
  const statusEdits = project._edits.status.all;

  for (const edit of statusEdits) {
    if (edit.value === targetStatus) {
      console.log({
        changeTime: edit.madeAt,
        lastUpdate: project.lastUpdate,
        changedBy: edit.by,
      });
    }
  }
}

// Example usage
findStatusChange(gardenProject, "active");
```
</CodeGroup>

### Common Use Cases

The time travel capabilities of CoValues enable several practical use cases that would otherwise require complex custom implementations. Here are some examples of how you can use time travel in your applications:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
// Track task progress over time
function getTaskStatusHistory(task: Task, days: number = 7) {
  const statusHistory = [];
  const dayInMs = 86400000;

  // Check every day for the past week
  for (let day = 0; day < days; day++) {
    const timePoint = new Date(Date.now() - day * dayInMs);
    // Using the internal _raw API to get state at a specific point in time
    const state = task._raw.atTime(timePoint);
    statusHistory.push({
      date: timePoint.toLocaleDateString(),
      status: state.status,
      priority: state.priority
    });
  }

  return statusHistory;
}

// Example usage
const history = getTaskStatusHistory(plantingTask);
history.forEach(entry => {
  console.log(`${entry.date}: Status was "${entry.status}" with ${entry.priority} priority`);
});
```
</CodeGroup>

### Best Practices

- Check field existence before accessing edits (`if (task._edits.fieldName)`)
- Access the most recent edit directly with `_edits.fieldName` instead of using any `.latest` property
- Cache historical queries if you're displaying them in UI
- Be specific about time ranges you care about
- Remember that accessing history requires loading the CoValue
- Consider using timestamps from your data rather than scanning all edits

Time travel is great for understanding how you got here, but keep queries focused on the range of time that matters to your use case.
