# How to share data between users through Organizations

This guide shows you how to share a set of CoValues between users. Different apps have different names for this concept, such as "teams" or "workspaces".

We'll use the term Organization.

[See the full example here.](https://github.com/garden-co/jazz/tree/main/examples/organization)

## Defining the schema for an Organization

Create a CoMap shared by the users of the same organization to act as a root (or "main database") for the shared data within an organization.

For this example, users within an `Organization` will be sharing `Project`s.

<FileName>schema.ts</FileName>
<CodeGroup>
```ts schema.ts#Basic
```
</CodeGroup>

Learn more about [defining schemas](/docs/core-concepts/covalues/overview).

## Adding a list of Organizations to the user's Account

Let's add the list of `Organization`s to the user's Account `root` so they can access them.

<CodeGroup>
```ts schema.ts#AddToRoot
```
</CodeGroup>

This schema now allows users to create `Organization`s and add `Project`s to them.

[See the schema for the example app here.](https://github.com/garden-co/jazz/blob/main/examples/organization/src/schema.ts)

## Adding members to an Organization

Here are different ways to add members to an `Organization`.

- Send users an invite link.
- [The user requests to join.](/docs/permissions-and-sharing/sharing#requesting-invites)

This guide and the example app show you the first method.

### Adding members through invite links

Here's how you can generate an [invite link](/docs/permissions-and-sharing/sharing#invites).

When the user accepts the invite, add the `Organization` to the user's `organizations` list.

{/* TODO: other frameworks */}

<TabbedCodeGroup default="react" savedPreferenceKey="framework" id="accept-invite">
<TabbedCodeGroupItem icon={<ReactLogo />} label="React" value="react" preferWrap>
```tsx react-snippet.tsx
```
</TabbedCodeGroupItem>
<TabbedCodeGroupItem icon={<SvelteLogo />} label="Svelte" value="svelte" preferWrap>
```svelte svelte.svelte
```
</TabbedCodeGroupItem>
</TabbedCodeGroup>
