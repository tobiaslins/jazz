# Frequently Asked Questions

## How established is Jazz?

Jazz is backed by fantastic angel and institutional investors with experience and know-how in devtools and has been in development since 2020.

## Will Jazz be around long-term?

We're committed to Jazz being around for a long time! We understand that when you choose Jazz for your projects, you're investing time and making a significant architectural choice, and we take that responsibility seriously.
That's why we've designed Jazz with longevity in mind from the start:

- The open source nature of our sync server means you'll always be able to run your own infrastructure
- Your data remains accessible even if our cloud services change
- We're designing the protocol as an open specification

This approach creates a foundation that can continue regardless of any single company's involvement. The local-first architecture means your apps will always work, even offline, and your data remains yours.
