# Jazz 0.15.0 - Moving everything inside `jazz-tools`

One of the pain points that our adopters have been facing while maintaining Jazz apps is keeping the different package versions aligned.

This becomes especially hard when using a monorepo setup for multi-platform apps.

To address this problem, we have decided to move all the bindings into a single package and export the different bindings using export paths.

## Overview:

So far, when building a Jazz app you would need to use multiple packages.

Now everything is inside `jazz-tools`:
<CodeGroup>
```tsx
import { co, z } from "jazz-tools";
import { useCoState } from "jazz-react"; // [!code --]
import { useCoState } from "jazz-tools/react"; // [!code ++]

export const TodoItem = co.map({
  name: z.string(),
});

export function TodoComponent({
  todoId
}: {
  todoId: string;
}) {
  const todo = useCoState(TodoItem, todoId);

  return (
    <input type="text" value={todo.name} onChange={(e) => (todo.name = e.target.value)} />
  );
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Major breaking changes

<ContentByFramework framework={["react-native", "vue", "vanilla", "react-native-expo", "svelte"]}>
- A single package for all: `jazz-tools` now exports all the bindings using export paths
- Support for Vue is discontinued: maintaining multiple framework bindings is hard and we prefer to focus our efforts on the most used frameworks in our community
</ContentByFramework>
<ContentByFramework framework={["react"]}>
- A single package for all: `jazz-tools` now exports all the bindings using export paths
- Support for Vue is discontinued: maintaining multiple framework bindings is hard and we prefer to focus our efforts on the most used frameworks in our community
- SSR is now stable: We have removed the experimental flag from `enableSSR` and unified `useAccount` and `useAccountOrGuest` hooks under the `useAccount` hook
</ContentByFramework>

### A single package for all

All our stable packages that were depending on `jazz-tools` are now part of the `jazz-tools` package:

- `jazz-react` -> `jazz-tools/react`
- `jazz-react-native` -> `jazz-tools/react-native`
- `jazz-expo` -> `jazz-tools/expo`
- `jazz-svelte` -> `jazz-tools/svelte`
- `jazz-nodejs` -> `jazz-tools/worker`
- `jazz-react-auth-clerk` -> `jazz-tools/react`
- `jazz-expo/auth/clerk` -> `jazz-tools/expo`
- `jazz-browser` -> `jazz-tools/browser`
- `jazz-browser-media-images` -> `jazz-tools/browser-media-images`
- `jazz-react-native-media-images` -> `jazz-tools/react-native-media-images`
- `jazz-inspector` -> `jazz-tools/inspector`
- `jazz-inspector-element` -> `jazz-tools/inspector/register-custom-element`
- `jazz-prosemirror` -> `jazz-tools/prosemirror`
- `jazz-tiptap` -> `jazz-tools/tiptap`

This means that now you can remove all these packages and keep only `jazz-tools`.

To reduce the probability of importing an API from the wrong entry, we have also done some renaming:
- `JazzProvider` becomes:
  - `JazzReactProvider` in `jazz-tools/react`
  - `JazzSvelteProvider` in `jazz-tools/svelte`
  - `JazzReactNativeProvider` in `jazz-tools/react-native`
  - `JazzExpoProvider` in `jazz-tools/expo`
- Clerk bindings are now exported directly from the framework entries and renamed as:
  - `import { JazzReactProviderWithClerk } from "jazz-tools/react"`
  - `import { JazzExpoProviderWithClerk } from "jazz-tools/expo"`
- We have added the `Native` suffix to the platform-specific hooks when imported from the `react-native` or `expo` entries:
  - `useAcceptInvite` -> `useAcceptInviteNative`
  - `useProgressiveImg` -> `useProgressiveImgNative`
  - `ProgressiveImg` -> `ProgressiveImgNative`
- `useAcceptInvite` becomes `new InviteListener` in Svelte

We have not renamed APIs like `useCoState` or `useAccount` because their implementation is cross-platform.

When experimenting with VSCode, we've noticed that usually the import path suggested is `jazz-tools/react-core`, which is the same as importing from `jazz-tools/react` or the specific framework entry.

<ContentByFramework framework={["react-native", "react-native-expo"]}>
To make this upgrade possible we have fully transtioned to [Package Exports](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/packages.html#package-entry-points) in `jazz-tools`.

This means that if you are using an old version of React Native you will need to enable the [enablePackageExports](https://metrobundler.dev/docs/configuration/#unstable_enablepackageexports-experimental) flag in your metro config.

### SSR is now stable

The `enableSSR` was marked as experimental because the `useAccount` return type was not matching the returned values in SSR mode.

In this release, we have refactored `useAccount` to make "me" always nullable, matching what happens when rendering on the server.

We have also removed `useAccountOrGuest` and made `useAccount` return an `agent` value that can be used to load data in all rendering modes.

For more details, check the [SSR docs](/docs/react/project-setup#nextjs-integration).
