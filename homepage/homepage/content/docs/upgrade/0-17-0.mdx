# Jazz 0.17.0 - New Image APIs

This release introduces a comprehensive refactoring of the image API, from creation to consumption. The result is a more flexible set of components and lower-level primitives that provide better developer experience and performance.

## Motivation

Before 0.17.0, the image APIs had several limitations:
- Progressive loading created confusion in usage patterns, and the API lacked flexibility to support all use cases
- The resize methods were overly opinionated, and the chosen library had compatibility issues in incognito mode
- The imperative functions for loading images were unnecessarily complex for simple use cases

## Breaking Changes

- The `createImage` options have been restructured, and the function has been moved to the `jazz-tools/media` namespace for both React and React Native
- The `<ProgressiveImg>` component has been replaced with `<Image>` from `jazz-tools/react`
- The `<ProgressiveImgNative>` component has been replaced with `<Image>` from `jazz-tools/react-native`
- The `highestResAvailable` function has been moved from `ImageDefinition.highestResAvailable` to `import { highestResAvailable } from "jazz-tools/media"`
- Existing image data remains compatible and accessible
- Progressive images created with previous versions will continue to work

## Changes

### `createImage` Function

The `createImage` function has been refactored to allow opt-in specific features and moved to the `jazz-tools/media` namespace.

<CodeGroup>
```tsx
export type CreateImageOptions = {
  owner?: Group | Account;
  placeholder?: "blur" | false;
  maxSize?: number;
  progressive?: boolean;
};
```
</CodeGroup>

- By default, images are now created with only the original size saved (no progressive loading or placeholder)
- The `maxSize` property is no longer restricted and affects the original size saved
- Placeholder generation is now a configurable property, disabled by default. Currently, only `"blur"` is supported, with more built-in options planned for future releases
- The `progressive` property creates internal resizes used exclusively via public APIs. Direct manipulation of internal resize state is no longer recommended

The `pica` library used internally for browser image resizing has been replaced with a simpler canvas-based implementation. Since every image manipulation library has trade-offs, we've chosen the simplest solution while providing flexibility through `createImageFactory`. This new factory function allows you to create custom `createImage` instances with your preferred libraries for resizing, placeholder generation, and source reading. It's used internally to create default instances for browsers, React Native, and Node.js environments.

### Replaced `<ProgressiveImg>` Component with `<Image>`

The `<ProgressiveImg>` component has been replaced with `<Image>` component for both React and React Native.

<CodeGroup>
```tsx
// Before
import { ProgressiveImg } from "jazz-tools/react";

<ProgressiveImg image={me.profile.image}>
  {({ src }) => <img alt="" src={src} className="w-full h-auto" />}
</ProgressiveImg>

// After
import { Image } from "jazz-tools/react";

<Image imageId={me.profile.image.id} alt="Profile" width={600} />
```
</CodeGroup>

The `width` and `height` props are now used internally to load the optimal image size, but only if progressive loading was enabled during image creation.

For detailed usage examples and API reference, see the [Image component documentation](/docs/react/using-covalues/imagedef#displaying-images).

### New `Image` Component for Svelte

A new `Image` component has been added for Svelte, featuring the same API as the React and React Native components.

<CodeGroup>
```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Image } from 'jazz-tools/svelte';
</script>

<Image
  imageId={image.id}
  alt=""
  class="h-auto max-h-[20rem] max-w-full rounded-t-xl mb-1"
  width={600}
/>
```
</CodeGroup>

For detailed usage examples and API reference, see the [Image component documentation](/docs/svelte/using-covalues/imagedef#displaying-images).

### New Image Loading Utilities

Two new utility functions are now available from the `jazz-tools/media` package:
- `loadImage` - Fetches the original image file by ID
- `loadImageBySize` - Fetches the best stored size for a given width and height

For detailed usage examples and API reference, see the [Image component documentation](/docs/vanilla/using-covalues/imagedef#displaying-images).
