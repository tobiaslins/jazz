# Jazz 0.16.0 - Cleaner separation between Zod and CoValue schemas

This release introduces a cleaner separation between Zod and CoValue schemas, improves type inference with circular references, and simplifies how you access internal schemas.
While most applications won't require extensive refactors, some breaking changes will require action.

## Motivation

Before 0.16.0, CoValue schemas were a thin wrapper around Zod schemas. This made it easy to use Zod methods on CoValue schemas,
but it also prevented the type checker from detecting issues when combining Zod and CoValue schemas.

For example, the following code would previously compile without errors, but would have severe limitations:

<CodeGroup>
```tsx
import { co, z } from "jazz-tools";

const Dog = co.map({
  breed: z.string(),
});
const Person = co.map({
  pets: z.array(Dog),
});

// You can create a CoMap with a z.array field that contains another CoMap
const map = Person.create({
  pets: [Dog.create({ breed: "Labrador" })],
});

// But then you cannot eagerly load the nested CoMap, because
// there's a plain JS object in between. So this would fail:
Person.load(map.id, { resolve: { pets: { $each: true } } });
```
</CodeGroup>

Schema composition rules are now stricter: Zod schemas can only be composed with other Zod schemas.
CoValue schemas can be composed with either Zod or other CoValue schemas. These rules are enforced at the type level, to make it easier
to spot errors in schema definitions and avoid possible footguns when mixing Zod and CoValue schemas.

Having a stricter separation between Zod and CoValue schemas also allowed us to improve type inference with circular references.
Previously, the type checker would not be able to infer types for even simple circular references, but now it can!
<CodeGroup>
```tsx
import { co, z } from "jazz-tools";

const Person = co.map({
  name: z.string(),
  get friends(): CoListSchema<typeof Person> { // [!code --]
  get friends() { // [!code ++]
    return co.list(Person);
  },
});
```
</CodeGroup>

There are some scenarios where recursive type inference can still fail due to TypeScript limitations, but these should be rare.

## Breaking changes

### `z.optional()` and `z.discriminatedUnion()` no longer work with CoValue schemas

You'll now need to use the `co.optional()` and `co.discriminatedUnion()` equivalents.
This change may require you to update any explicitly typed cyclic references.

<CodeGroup>
```tsx
import { co, z } from "jazz-tools";

const Person = co.map({
  name: z.string(),
  get bestFriend(): z.ZodOptional<typeof Person> { // [!code --]
    return z.optional(Person); // [!code --]
  get bestFriend(): co.Optional<typeof Person> { // [!code ++]
    return co.optional(Person); // [!code ++]
  }
});
```
</CodeGroup>

### CoValue schema types are now under the `co.` namespace

All CoValue schema types are now accessed via the `co.` namespace. If you're using explicit types (especially in recursive schemas), you'll need to update them accordingly.

<CodeGroup>
```tsx
import { co, z } from "jazz-tools";

const Person = co.map({
  name: z.string(),
  get friends(): CoListSchema<typeof Person> { // [!code --]
  get friends(): co.List<typeof Person> { // [!code ++]
    return co.list(Person);
  }
});
```
</CodeGroup>

### Unsupported Zod methods have been removed from CoMap schemas

CoMap schemas no longer incorrectly inherit Zod methods like `.extend()` and `.partial()`. These methods previously appeared to work but could behave unpredictably. They've now been disabled.

We're keeping `.optional()`, and plan to introduce more Zod-like methods in future releases.

### Internal schema access is now simpler

You no longer need to use Zod's `.def` to access schema internals. Instead, you can directly use methods like `CoMapSchema.shape`, `CoListSchema.element`, and `CoOptionalSchema.innerType`.

<CodeGroup>
```tsx
import { co, z } from "jazz-tools";

const Message = co.map({
  content: co.richText(),
});

const Thread = co.map({
  messages: co.list(Message),
});

const thread = Thread.create({
  messages: Thread.def.shape.messages.create([ // [!code --]
  messages: Thread.shape.messages.create([ // [!code ++]
    Message.create({
      content: co.richText().create("Hi!"),
    }),
    Message.create({
      content: co.richText().create("What's up?"),
    }),
  ]),
});
```
</CodeGroup>

### Removed the deprecated `withHelper` method from CoValue schemas

The deprecated `withHelpers()` method has been removed from CoValue schemas. You can define helper functions manually to encapsulate CoValue-related logic.
