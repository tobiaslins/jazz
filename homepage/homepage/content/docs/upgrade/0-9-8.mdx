# Jazz 0.9.8 - Without me!

We have simplified the API to make the "me" value always optional!

This removes the need of using `useAccount` like the 90% of the time!

<CodeGroup>
    {/* prettier-ignore */}
    ```ts
    import { useState } from "react";
    import { Issue } from "./schema";
    import { IssueComponent } from "./components/Issue.tsx";

    function App() {
        const [issue, setIssue] = useState<Issue>();

        const createIssue = () => {
            setIssue(Issue.create(
                {
                    title: "Buy terrarium",
                    description: "Make sure it's big enough for 10 snails.",
                    estimate: 5,
                    status: "backlog",
                }, // The owner defaults now to a group managed by the current user!
            ));
        };

        if (issue) {
            return <IssueComponent issue={issue} />;
        } else {
            return <button onClick={createIssue}>Create Issue</button>;
        }
    }
    ```
</CodeGroup>

This also applies to the load API:

<CodeGroup>
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  ```ts
  const issue = Issue.load(issueId, {})
  ```
</CodeGroup>

And `Group.create`:

<CodeGroup>
    {/* prettier-ignore */}
    ```tsx
    const group = Group.create()
    const sharedIssue = Issue.create(payload, group)
    group.addMember('everyone', 'reader')
    ```
</CodeGroup>

Everything is backward compatible, so no upgrade steps are required.

With this Jazz API becomes way more lean and more is coming!
