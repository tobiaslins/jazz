# Groups as members

Groups can be added to other groups using the `addMember` method.

When a group is added as a member of another group, members of the added group will become part of the containing group.

## Basic usage

Here's how to add a group as a member of another group:

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { Group } from "jazz-tools";
// ---cut---
const playlistGroup = Group.create();
const trackGroup = Group.create();

// Tracks are now visible to the members of playlist
trackGroup.addMember(playlistGroup);
```
</CodeGroup>

When you add groups as members:
- Members of the added group become members of the container group
- Their roles are inherited (with some exceptions, see [below](#the-rules-of-role-inheritance))
- Revoking access from the member group also removes its access to the container group

## Levels of inheritance

Adding a group as a member of another is not limited in depth:

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { Group } from "jazz-tools";
// ---cut---
const grandParentGroup = Group.create();
const parentGroup = Group.create();
const childGroup = Group.create();

childGroup.addMember(parentGroup);
parentGroup.addMember(grandParentGroup);
```
</CodeGroup>

Members of the grandparent group will get access to all descendant groups based on their roles.

## Roles

### The rules of role inheritance

If the account is already a member of the container group, it will get the more permissive role:
<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { Group } from "jazz-tools";
import { createJazzTestAccount } from 'jazz-tools/testing';
const bob = await createJazzTestAccount();
// ---cut---
const addedGroup = Group.create();
addedGroup.addMember(bob, "reader");

const containingGroup = Group.create();
addedGroup.addMember(bob, "writer");
containingGroup.addMember(addedGroup);

// Bob stays a writer because his role is higher
// than the inherited reader role.
```
</CodeGroup>

When adding a group to another group, only admin, writer and reader roles are inherited:
<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { Group } from "jazz-tools";
import { createJazzTestAccount } from 'jazz-tools/testing';
const bob = await createJazzTestAccount();
// ---cut---
const addedGroup = Group.create();
addedGroup.addMember(bob, "writeOnly");

const containingGroup = Group.create();
containingGroup.addMember(addedGroup);

// Bob does not become a member of the containing group
```
</CodeGroup>

To add a group to another group:

1. The current account must be an admin in the containing group
2. The current account must be a member of the added group

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { co, Group } from "jazz-tools";
const group = Group.create();
const Company = co.map({});
const company = Company.create({ owner: group });
// ---cut---
const companyGroup = company._owner.castAs(Group);
const teamGroup = Group.create();

// Works only if I'm a member of `companyGroup`
teamGroup.addMember(companyGroup);
```
</CodeGroup>

### Overriding the added group's roles

In some cases you might want to inherit all members from an added group but override their roles to the same specific role in the containing group. You can do so by passing an "override role" as a second argument to `addMember`:

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { Group } from "jazz-tools";
import { createJazzTestAccount } from 'jazz-tools/testing';
const bob = await createJazzTestAccount();
// ---cut---
const organizationGroup = Group.create();
organizationGroup.addMember(bob, "admin");

const billingGroup = Group.create();

// This way the members of the organization
// can only read the billing data
billingGroup.addMember(organizationGroup, "reader");
```
</CodeGroup>

The "override role" works in both directions:

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { Group } from "jazz-tools";
import { createJazzTestAccount } from 'jazz-tools/testing';
const alice = await createJazzTestAccount();
const bob = await createJazzTestAccount();
// ---cut---
const addedGroup = Group.create();
addedGroup.addMember(bob, "reader");
addedGroup.addMember(alice, "admin");

const containingGroup = Group.create();
containingGroup.addMember(addedGroup, "writer");

// Bob and Alice are now writers in the containing group
```
</CodeGroup>

### Permission changes

When you remove a member from an added group, they automatically lose access to all containing groups. We handle key rotation automatically to ensure security.

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { Group } from "jazz-tools";
import { createJazzTestAccount } from 'jazz-tools/testing';
const bob = await createJazzTestAccount();
const addedGroup = Group.create();
// ---cut---
// Remove member from added group
await addedGroup.removeMember(bob);

// Bob loses access to both groups.
// If Bob was also a member of the containing group,
// he wouldn't have lost access.
```
</CodeGroup>

## Removing groups from other groups

You can remove a group from another group by using the `removeMember` method:

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { Group } from "jazz-tools";
// ---cut---
const addedGroup = Group.create();
const containingGroup = Group.create();

containingGroup.addMember(addedGroup);

// Revoke the extension
await containingGroup.removeMember(addedGroup);
```
</CodeGroup>

## Getting all added groups

You can get all of the groups added to a group by calling the `getParentGroups` method:

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { Group } from "jazz-tools";
// ---cut---
const containingGroup = Group.create();
const addedGroup = Group.create();
containingGroup.addMember(addedGroup);

console.log(containingGroup.getParentGroups()); // [addedGroup]
```
</CodeGroup>

## Group hierarchy on CoValue creation

When creating CoValues that contain other CoValues using plain JSON objects, Jazz not only creates
the necessary CoValues automatically but it will also manage their group ownership.

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { co } from "jazz-tools";

// ---cut---
const Task = co.plainText();
const Column = co.list(Task);
const Board = co.map({
  title: z.string(),
  columns: co.list(Column),
});

const board = Board.create({
  title: "My board",
  columns: [
    ["Task 1.1", "Task 1.2"],
    ["Task 2.1", "Task 2.2"],
  ],
});
```
</CodeGroup>

For each created column and task CoValue, Jazz also creates a new group as its owner and
adds the referencing CoValue's owner as a member of that group. This allows you to then manage
permissions for each CoValue independently.

If you prefer to manage permissions differently, you can always create CoValues explicitly:

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { co } from "jazz-tools";

const Task = co.plainText();
const Column = co.list(Task);
const Board = co.map({
  title: z.string(),
  columns: co.list(Column),
});

// ---cut---
// Set a single group as the owner of all CoValues
const group = Group.create();
const board = Board.create({
  title: "My board",
  columns: co.list(Column, group).create([
    Column.create([
      Task.create("Task 1.1", group),
      Task.create("Task 1.2", group),
    ], group),
    Column.create([
      Task.create("Task 2.1", group),
      Task.create("Task 2.2", group),
    ], group),
  ]),
}, group);
```
</CodeGroup>

## Example: Team Hierarchy

Here's a practical example of using group inheritance for team permissions:

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { Group } from "jazz-tools";
import { createJazzTestAccount } from 'jazz-tools/testing';
const CEO = await createJazzTestAccount();
const teamLead = await createJazzTestAccount();
const developer = await createJazzTestAccount();
const client = await createJazzTestAccount();
// ---cut---
// Company-wide group
const companyGroup = Group.create();
companyGroup.addMember(CEO, "admin");

// Team group with elevated permissions
const teamGroup = Group.create();
teamGroup.addMember(companyGroup); // Inherits company-wide access
teamGroup.addMember(teamLead, "admin");
teamGroup.addMember(developer, "writer");

// Project group with specific permissions
const projectGroup = Group.create();
projectGroup.addMember(teamGroup); // Inherits team permissions
projectGroup.addMember(client, "reader"); // Client can only read project items
```
</CodeGroup>

This creates a hierarchy where:
- The CEO has admin access to everything
- Team members get writer access to team and project content
- Team leads get admin access to team and project content
- The client can only read project content
