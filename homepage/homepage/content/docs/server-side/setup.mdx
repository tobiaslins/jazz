# Running Jazz on the server

Jazz is a distributed database that can be used on both clients or servers without any distinction.

You can use servers to:
- perform operations that can't be done on the client (e.g. sending emails, making HTTP requests, etc.)
- validate actions that require a central authority (e.g. a payment gateway, booking a hotel, etc.)

We call the code that runs on the server a "Server Worker".

The main difference to keep in mind when working with Jazz compared to traditional systems is that server code doesn't have any
special or privileged access to the user data. You need to be explicit about what you want to share with the server.

This means that your server workers will have their own accounts, and they need to be explicitly given access to the CoValues they need to work on.

## Generating credentials

Server Workers typically have static credentials, consisting of a public Account ID and a private Account Secret.

To generate new credentials for a Server Worker, you can run:

<CodeGroup>
```sh
npx jazz-run account create --name "My Server Worker"
```
</CodeGroup>

The name will be put in the public profile of the Server Worker's `Account`, which can be helpful when inspecting metadata of CoValue edits that the Server Worker has done.

<Alert variant="info" className="mt-4" title="Note">
  By default the account will be stored in Jazz Cloud. You can use the `--peer` flag to store the account on a different sync server.
</Alert>

## Running a server worker

You can use `startWorker` to run a Server Worker. Similarly to setting up a client-side Jazz context, it:

- takes a custom `AccountSchema` if you have one (for example, because the worker needs to store information in its private account root)
- takes a URL for a sync & storage server

The migration defined in the `AccountSchema` will be executed every time the worker starts, the same way as it would be for a client-side Jazz context.

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { co } from "jazz-tools";
const MyWorkerAccount = co.account();
type MyWorkerAccount = co.loaded<typeof MyWorkerAccount>;

/**
 * Use your email as a temporary key, or get a free
 * API Key at dashboard.jazz.tools for higher limits.
 * 
 * @link https://dashboard.jazz.tools
*/
const apiKey = "you@example.com";

// ---cut---
import { startWorker } from 'jazz-tools/worker';

const { worker } = await startWorker({
  AccountSchema: MyWorkerAccount,
  syncServer: `wss://cloud.jazz.tools/?key=${apiKey}`,
  accountID: process.env.JAZZ_WORKER_ACCOUNT,
  accountSecret: process.env.JAZZ_WORKER_SECRET,
});
```
</CodeGroup>

`worker` is an instance of the `Account` schema provided, and acts like `me` (as returned by `useAccount` on the client).

It will implicitly become the current account, and you can avoid mentioning it in most cases.

For this reason we also recommend running a single worker instance per server, because it makes your code much more predictable.

In case you want to avoid setting the current account, you can pass `asActiveAccount: false` to `startWorker`.

## Storing & providing credentials

Server Worker credentials are typically stored and provided as environment variables.

**Take extra care with the Account Secret &mdash; handle it like any other secret environment variable such as a DB password.**

## Wasm on Edge runtimes

To maximize compatibility, Jazz falls back to a slower, JavaScript crypto implementation if the faster WASM implementation is not available.

On some edge platforms, such as Cloudflare Workers or Vercel Edge Functions, environment security restrictions may trigger this fallback unnecessarily.

You can ensure that Jazz uses the faster WASM implementation by importing the WASM loader before using Jazz. For example:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
import "jazz-tools/load-edge-wasm"
// Other Jazz Imports

export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    // Jazz application logic
    return new Response("Hello from Jazz on Cloudflare!");
  },
};
```
</CodeGroup>

Currently, the Jazz Loader is tested on the following edge environments:
- Cloudflare Workers 
- Vercel Functions

### Requirements

- Edge runtime environment that supports WebAssembly
- `jazz-tools/load-edge-wasm` must be imported before any Jazz import


## Node-API

Jazz supports a native Node.js implementation of its core crypto, but it is not enabled by default.

You can use it as follows:

<CodeGroup>
```ts
import { startWorker } from "jazz-tools/worker";
import { NapiCrypto } from "jazz-tools/worker/napi";

const { worker } = await startWorker({
  syncServer: `wss://cloud.jazz.tools/?key=${apiKey}`,
  accountID: process.env.JAZZ_WORKER_ACCOUNT,
  accountSecret: process.env.JAZZ_WORKER_SECRET,
  crypto: await NapiCrypto.create(),
});

```
</CodeGroup>

<Alert variant="info" className="mt-4" title="Note">
  The Node-API implementation is not available on all platforms. It is only available on Node.js 20.x and higher.
  The supported platforms are:
  - macOS (x64, ARM64)
  - Linux (x64, ARM64, ARM, musl)

  It does not work in edge runtimes.
